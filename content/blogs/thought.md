Polish by chatgpt3.5:
The global economy continues to struggle following the reopening in 2023 after the initial downturn in 2020. With ongoing conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the war in Gaza, as well as the competition between China and the West, led by the US, the future appears uncertain and unstable. This crisis has had a deep impact on countries around the world, including China. Despite a 5.2% increase in GDP last year, China is facing challenges such as a high unemployment rate among graduates, a real estate crisis, structural issues in industry, and new cultural conflicts among its citizens, elites, and authorities. It is imperative for countries to address these challenges through cooperation, dialogue, and strategic planning to navigate through these turbulent times. If you have any specific questions or topics you would like to further discuss, please feel free to ask.
